👋 Hi, I’m @kcafernandes  
  I’m a Robotics Engineering major at UC Riverside who’s really interested in the **software side of robotics** 

I’m interested in …  
  - computer vision (OpenCV, perception pipelines)  
  - robotics software + autonomous systems  
  - C++ programming & performance-oriented logic  
  - embedded systems + microcontrollers  
  - AI for real-world robotics  

I’m currently learning …  
  - C++ (OOP, data structures, multi-file projects)  
  - Python for vision + automation  
  - LC-3 assembly & low-level logic  
  - algorithms + system design fundamentals  
  - how real robots process sensor data  

I’m looking to collaborate on …  
  - robotics software projects  
  - C++ apps, games, and tools  
  - AI/vision-based projects  
  - embedded or microcontroller systems  

How to reach me …
